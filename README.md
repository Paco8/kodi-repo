# Test repo
This repo for kodi provides modified versions of the netflix, amazon, hbogoeu and disney+ addons, with support for [ttml2ssa](https://github.com/Paco8/ttml2ssa), which provides better looking and more customizable substitles.

After installing any of the addons you'll see a new addon:

You can configure in it the look of the subtitles and other options:
